		<h2>A Bit About Me:</h2>
		<p>My name is Timothy Moran, but I go by Timmy.  I am a senior at Fordham University (Bronx, NY) persuing a BS in Computer Science.
		   I went to a high school called <a href="http://www.gonzaga.org" target="_blank">Gonzaga</a>.  Gonzaga is a all boys high school located in the heart of Washington D.C., only a couple blocks away from the U.S. Capitol Building.
		   At Gonzaga I learned how to play rugby, and that is part of what lead me to Fordham University.  I play rugby here at Fordham (<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/21393/menand039s_rugby" target ="_blank">Here</a> is a link to our website), and I have started for the "A Side" (the side that competes on the highest level) since my freshman year.</p>
