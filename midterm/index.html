						<p><img src="./img/timmy_rugby.jpg" width="186" height="186" alt="Timmy Playing Rugby" class="alignleft border" />My name is Timothy Moran, but I go by Timmy.  I am a senior at Fordham University (Bronx, NY) persuing a BS in Computer Science.
					   I went to a high school called <a href="http://www.gonzaga.org" target="_blank">Gonzaga</a>.  Gonzaga is a all boys high school located in the heart of Washington D.C., only a couple blocks away from the U.S. Capitol Building.
					   Gonzaga I learned how to play rugby, and that is part of what lead me to Fordham University.  I play rugby here at Fordham (<a href="https://www.fordham.edu/info/21393/menand039s_rugby" target ="_blank">Here</a> is a link to our website), and I have started for the "A Side" (the side that competes on the highest level) since my freshman year.</p>

								The color scheme I have chosen for this first page of my website are the colors of my favorite professional sports team, the Washington Redskins.  The Washington Resdkins have been my favorite team to watch since I was a kid.  My dream is that one day the Resdkins will win the Super Bowl and end the long championship drought in the District of Columbia.  Washington D.C. has a professional sports team in each of the main four pro sports leagues in the US.  The Wizards in the NBA, the Capitals in the NHL, the Nationals in the MLB, and (of course) the Resdkins in the NFL.  Since I've been alive, no D.C. sports team has won a championship.  Not even our MLS team, the DC United, can manage to get us a title.  When I was younger, there was no professional baseball team in D.C.  Because of this, my father reaisd me as a New York Yankees fan.  I am always thankful that I have the Yankees, because otherwise I would never have gotten to see a team I love win a championship. "God Bless the Yankees!"
